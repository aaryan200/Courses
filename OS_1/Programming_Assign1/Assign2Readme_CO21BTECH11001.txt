Instructions to run code:

1. Use these flags while compiling:
   -lm      (for linking math.h)
   -pthread (for linking pthread.h)
   i.e., gcc Assign2Src_CO21BTECH11001.c -lm -pthread

2. Make sure to give input file as command line argument.
   i.e, ./a.out input.txt

3. You can add more test cases in input.txt
   Note: Please make sure that there is only one space between the two numbers.

4. If you are running code again, please make sure to delete all the new directories created
   in previous execution, otherwise it will not be able to make new directories.
   For e.g., if directory "Input_1" is already present, then it will print
   "Please remove the directory Input_1 and run again" and terminate.
   If you don't want to delete the new directories created, then copy paste the input file and
   the source code to another directory and run it.

5. New directories will be generated after successful execution.
   Directories are named as follows:
   For 1st input in input file: Input_1 is created.
   For 2nd input in input file: Input_2 is created.
   and so on.

6. Each directory will consist of following files:
   Main.log: log file generated by main thread
   Thread_1.log: log file generated by 1st thread
   Thread_2.log: log file generated by 2nd thread
   .
   .
   Thread_k.log: log file generated by kth thread
