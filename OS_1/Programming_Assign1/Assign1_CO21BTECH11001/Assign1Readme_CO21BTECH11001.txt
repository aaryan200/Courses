Instructions to run code:
1. Make sure input.txt is contained in same directory as source code.
2. Use flag -lrt while compiling the code
   i.e. gcc Assign1Src_CO21BTECH11001.c -lrt
   This is due to inclusion of the library "sys/shm.h"
   Ignore the warnings about sprintf.
3. You can add more input cases in input.txt
   Note: Please make sure that there is only one space between the two numbers.
   Also, update the variable num_lines in line number 42 of source code.
4. If you are running code again, please make sure to delete all the new directories created
   in previous execution, otherwise it will not be able to make new directories.
   If you don't want to delete the new directories created, then copy paste the input file and
   the source code to another directory and run it.
