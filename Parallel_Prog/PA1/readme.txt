To execute the program, follow these steps:

1. Compile the file
    Example: g++ DAM-CO21BTECH11001.cpp
    or g++ SAM-CO21BTECH11001.cpp

2. Run the executable and provide the name of input file as command line argument
    Example: ./a.out input.txt

3. File named DAM-CO21BTECH11001.cpp will output two files on execution. One of the files named output_dam1.txt contains the prime numbers in the range [1, N] and the another file named time_dam1.txt contains the time taken to execute.

4. File named SAM-CO21BTECH11001.cpp will output two files on execution. One of the files named output_sam1.txt contains the prime numbers in the range [1, N] and the another file named time_sam1.txt contains the time taken to execute.
